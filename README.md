All necessary changes to build Halium for ja3gxx.

EXPERIMENTAL. 

If you want to build halium for ja3gxx that will be all necessary changes you will need. It's building succesfully with halium7.1 sources but I couldn't have a chance to get it boot. There could be some mistake which is done by me, I'm sorry about that and let's see can we ever boot it up. Good luck.
